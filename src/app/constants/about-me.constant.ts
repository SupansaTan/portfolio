`Now, I have just completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering
at King Mongkut University of Technology North Bangkok (KMUTNB).

I have had the opportunity to intern as a Full Stack Developer for
3 months, working mainly with Angular and ASP.NET Core frameworks.

I'm also open to doing freelance work during the end of the semester
of second-year, primarily creating websites from designs, which I usually
work with React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript.
